# QUBOPortfolio
This repository contains the `QUBOPortfolio` Julia module which is designed to solve Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. 
The portfolio uses Random Forest or XGBoost models to select the optimal metaheuristics for a given problem instance, which are then executed in parallel across available computational resources.

## Example Usage
See examples in the [experiments](experiments/) folder.

## Thesis
This project is the source code for my [Master's Thesis](thesis/thesis.pdf).

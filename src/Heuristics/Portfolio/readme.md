# Portfolio

This heuristic type describes the `QUBOPortfolio` metaheuristic, a core concept of this repository.

A `Portfolio` is not a single heuristic but rather a collection of different heuristics with a selection mechanism.

The main implementation, `QUBOPortfolio`, is defined in the root [`Portfolio` directory](../../Portfolio) of this project.
